A small Qwen2.5-Coder model served locally by `llama-server` (llama.cpp) over its
OpenAI-compatible endpoint - no Ollama install required. At 1.5B it is fast and
cheap, fit for the lightweight triage/classification role but not for real work.

It is marked `triageOnly`, so Auto only ever routes the internal triage step to
it - never the planner, answerer, or executor, even when no other model is
available (those then fail with a "no model" hint rather than doing real work on
a 1.5B model). To use it for actual work anyway, pin it explicitly with
`myDevTeam.model` set to `llamacpp-local` or `provider:llamacpp`; a pin always
wins over the `triageOnly` guard.

The `model` field is the id sent to `llama-server`; it matches what the server
advertises at `/v1/models` for the `-hf ggml-org/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-Q8_0-GGUF`
launch. In its usual single-model mode the server answers regardless of the name,
so change this if you serve a different model.
