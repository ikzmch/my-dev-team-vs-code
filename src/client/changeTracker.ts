/**
 * Collects the files a turn's executor actually wrote and edits them into a
 * one-glance "N files changed, +X -Y" summary. This is a client seam (like the
 * Approver, the RunMirror, and the EvalLog): the writes land on the user's
 * machine through the WorkspaceToolHost whichever engine drives the loop, so
 * the tracker stays client-side and keeps working unchanged when a remote
 * engine is added.
 *
 * The tracker is a shared singleton handed to the ToolHost, but the summary is
 * per turn, so each turn opens a session - exactly like the ChatApprover. A
 * reported write is attributed to the most recently opened session; with a
 * shared ToolHost a call cannot be tied back to a specific request, so under
 * concurrent turns this is best-effort (the same documented limitation the
 * approver carries), which is fine for a stats line.
