/**
 * The extension's ToolHost: the one place a tool call from an engine (or from
 * the editor's Language Model Tools surface, see registerTools.ts) is
 * validated and dispatched onto the workspace implementations. Whichever
 * engine is selected - in-process today, remote later - the hands stay here:
 * file access, the shell, the approval gate, and the run mirror all live on
 * the user's machine, so an engine can only ever *ask* for a side effect.
 *
 * Dispatch is derived from the protocol's tool contract rather than written
 * out per tool: `handlers` carries one entry per `clientTools` name, and
 * `execute` looks the call up, parses with the contract's schema, and invokes
 * it. There is no per-tool branch to keep in step with the contract - a tool
 * added to `clientTools` with no handler (or a handler reading the wrong
 * argument) is a compile error, so the name set cannot drift between the
 * contract, the host, and the editor registrations (registerTools.ts already
 * iterates the same contract and delegates here).
